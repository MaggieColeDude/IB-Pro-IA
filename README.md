# SL Comp-IA: The Power of Circuitry, Margaret Cole, Period: 4B 
This repository is dedicated to my standard level (SL) computer science internal assessment (IA) for the international baccalaureate program. The Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA) is officially called 'The Solution.' It involves using Computing technology to solve a problem for a real-life client. The IA accounts for 30% of the total Standard Level (SL) grade and 20% of the Higher Level (HL) grade. Learn more here --> https://ib.compscihub.net/internal. 
The repository will be sorted and marked according to the IB criteria each section belongs to. The criteria are as follows: 

Criterion A – Planning – 6 marks

Criterion B – Record of Tasks (RoT) and Design – 6 marks (ROT_blank)

Criterion C – Development – 12 marks

Criterion D – Functionality (Video) – 4 marks

Criterion E – Evaluation – 6 marks

# Rule of Thumb (Remove later) 
1. Arrays
2. User-defined objects
3. Objects as data records
4. Simple selection (if–else)
5. Complex selection (nested if, if with multiple conditions or switch)
6. Loops
7. Nested loops
8. User-defined methods
9. User-defined methods with parameters (the parameters have to be useful and used within the method body)
10. User-defined methods with appropriate return values (primitives or objects)
11. Sorting
12. Searching
13. File i/o
14. Use of additional libraries (such as utilities and graphical libraries not included in appendix 2 Java Examination Tool Subsets)
15. Use of sentinels or Flags

# "The Scenario" (Criterion A)
The client is my physics teacher, Mr.Lambert, who has been struggling to find an adequate online circuit simulator for his beginner physics class. Many builders he finds online are missing key aspects, such as voltage level indicators, or don't provide enough information/ visual aid on how the scientific process works; instead, they leave many elements up to user interpretation, which has caused his students to become more confused by circuitry than enlightened. After consulting with him, I suggested we create a simulation equipped with personalized visuals/ features he can choose to implement into the program. This resulted in ideas like creating different colors for the wires to indicate voltage levels with a key as a visual aid and infographics to explain the step-by-step scientific process.  
# "The Rationale" (Criterion A)
To solve Mr. Lambert's problem, I will create a simulator with clear graphics that explains the process in a still fun yet concise manner. This will be done through the usage of interactive graphics and a step-by-step explanation of why the processes of circuitry. 

Outline: Why Java is ideal for creating a circuit builder simulation: 
1. Platform independence (Cross-platform capability):   
Java would make it easier to reach a broader range of users on any platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.
3. Object-Oriented Design (OOP):   
Java's modular structure allows for the creation of reusable components (Resistors, capacitors, wires, etc.), and new features can be added without disrupting the core structure.
3. Concurrency and Multithreading:
In a circuit-building program, simulations require complex and often computationally intensive calculations. Java’s built-in support for multithreading and concurrency handles these things more efficiently, improving the program’s performance and responsiveness.
4. Optimization: While Java isn’t as low-level as C or C++, it is still highly optimized through the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and garbage collection.
5. 
# "Success Criteria" (Criterion A) 
(~5-7 relevant criteria and adequately evaluate your project.)
1. The client can easily add new components to the circuit builder
2. The client can interact and change the amount of voltage in the simulator
3. The program relays the process step by step through a visual infographic
4. The client can delete components of the circuit builder
5. The program can easily calculate and explain Ohm's law.
